My proudest professional achievement is graduating with a CS degree in four years on a full academic scholarship. During this time, I have been able to work on several diverse projects, from websites to games to compilers. I've also been able to collaborate with other students, like during my Software Engineering class when I designed a Monopoly implementation with two classmates. Another interesting project I did during school was designing an environment that simulates a robot navigating across obstacles, guided by intelligent pathfinding algorithms like A* and Potential Search.
